      <h1>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</h1>
      <p class="banner_text">
        Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a subsidiary of Amazon providing on-demand
        cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and
        governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. These cloud computing web
        services provide a variety of basic abstract technical infrastructure
        and distributed computing building blocks and tools. One of these
        services is Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), which allows users to
        have at their disposal a virtual cluster of computers, available all the
        time, through the Internet. AWS's version of virtual computers emulates
        most of the attributes of a real computer, including hardware central
        processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) for
        processing; local/RAM memory; hard-disk/SSD storage; a choice of
        operating systems; networking; and pre-loaded application software such
        as web servers, databases, and customer relationship management (CRM).
      </p>
      <p class="banner_text">
        The AWS technology is implemented at server farms throughout the world,
        and maintained by the Amazon subsidiary. Fees are based on a combination
        of usage (known as a "Pay-as-you-go" model), hardware, operating system,
        software, or networking features chosen by the subscriber required
        availability, redundancy, security, and service options. Subscribers can
        pay for a single virtual AWS computer, a dedicated physical computer, or
        clusters of either. As part of the subscription agreement, Amazon
        provides security for subscribers' systems. AWS operates from many
        global geographical regions including 6 in North America.
